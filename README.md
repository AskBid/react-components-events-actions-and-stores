# Components, Events, Actions, and Stores

## Objectives

1. Review interactions between different parts of a React application
2. Discuss trade-offs and benefits of one-way data flow

## Overview

This reading is meant to give students a chance to catch their breath and review
some of the big ideas that they've covered in recent lessons. Feel free to
rehash/refactor previous examples â€” we want to make sure students have a strong
base before plowing ahead too quickly.

Emphasize the basic flux flow (sans dispatcher);

Component renders -> User triggers event -> Action -> Store -> Component renders...
